Kount provides a way for merchants to include additional information related to their business that may not be a standard field in Kount by creating user defined fields. UDFs are created in the Agent Web Console by browsing to the Fraud Control tab and clicking on User Defined Fields. Once you have defined the UDF in the Agent Web Console you will be able to pass this data into Kount via an array called UDF as key-value pairs where the label is the key and the data passed in is the value. The maximum number of UDFs that can be created is 500, and response time for evaluating transactions will degrade as more UDFs are added. There are four data types available for user defined fields.
