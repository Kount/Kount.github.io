## Overview
The following guide is intended to help our Clients quickly understand the scope needed to integrate with Kount’s digital account protection APIs and to provide a high-level overview of integration points and flow.
During integration, Kount will provide support for the Client’s development staff including direct access to Kount’s Solution Engineers. This direct communication is to facilitate quick, accurate responses to integration questions your development team might have.
