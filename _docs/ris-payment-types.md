Kount supports multiple payment types and depending upon the payment type chosen by the customer certain payment tokens are required. If the PayPal Payer ID or Google Checkout Account ID is not sent in the inquiry mode, then it must be sent in the update mode related to the transaction otherwise the order details will not be displayed in the Agent Web Console.
