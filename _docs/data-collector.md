The Kount Data Collector is designed to run in the background while a webpage loads in a client
browser, or while in a mobile application (iOS or Android, see link below for mobile SDKs).

{% include alert.html style="primary" text="The Inquiry Services (for Kount Complete or Kount Access) are designed to be used in conjunction with the Data Collection process. The Data Collection process is passive and provides no information back to a Merchant (Client). There is optional "callback" code that can provide a Merchant (Client) information regarding when the Data Collection has finished." %}
