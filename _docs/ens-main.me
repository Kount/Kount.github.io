The Event Notification System (ENS) provides merchants the ability to have specific automated interactions without the need of the Agent Web Console. When enabled, notifications from Kount are sent to you as a series of events formatted in XML. Upon receipt of the information, the receiving system sends a confirmation message to Kount verifying the data was received. Examples include the assignment of a transaction to an agent, dynamic rescores, a change in a customer’s network type, or updated information after the Reevaluate button has been selected. While it’s typical for businesses to set up a single website/web server to receive such data, businesses with a high volume of transaction activity can configure multiple websites and servers; one for each event type. While events occur in real time, to avoid overwhelming your web server the data is queued and sent every 30 seconds by default.
