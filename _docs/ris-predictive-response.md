Predictive Response is a mechanism that can be used by Kount merchants to submit test requests and receive back predictable RIS responses. This means that a merchant, in order to test RIS, can generate a particular request that is designed to provide one or more specific RIS responses and/or errors. The predictive response inquiries are not actual RIS inquiries, which means the data will never be submitted to the database and will not be displayed in the Agent Web Console.
