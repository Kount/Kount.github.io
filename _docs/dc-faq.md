#### Q: Where do I get the Merchant ID?
A Sandbox Boarding Information document will be sent following the initial kick-off call. It contains the Merchant ID and URLs associated with the DC and RIS processes. A separate document for production will be sent with the production service URLs once the test transactions are certified.

#### Q: How do I receive a login to the Agent Web Console?
Kount will create the initial administrator user. Once the user has been created, an automated e-mail will be sent requesting a password creation.

#### Q: Should I send production traffic to the test environment?
Production traffic should not be sent to the test environment due to the possibility of skewed scoring from the test orders.
