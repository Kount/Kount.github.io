RIS data posted to Kount must be URL encoded and submitted as key-value pairs. Much of the work can be simplified by utilizing a Kount provided SDK, including URL encoding. Kount provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java, .NET, PHP, Perl, and Mobile environments.

Recommendations regarding each development environment and their supported versions, configuration, logging, and paths are found in the README file located in the “docs“ directory in each respective SDK, please read the documentation associated with each SDK.
